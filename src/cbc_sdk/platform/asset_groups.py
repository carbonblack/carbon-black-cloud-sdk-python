"""
The model and query classes for referencing asset groups.

An *asset group* represents a group of devices (endpoints, VM workloads, and/or VDIs) that can have a single policy
applied to it so the protections of all similar assets are synchronized with one another.  Policies carry a "position"
value as one of their attributes, so that, between the policy attached directly to the device, and the policies
attached to any asset groups the device is a member of, the one with the highest "position" is the one that applies to
that device.  Devices may be added to an asset group either explicitly, or implicitly by specifying a query on the
asset group, such that all devices matching that search criteria are considered part of the asset group.

Typical usage example::

    # assume "cb" is an instance of CBCloudAPI
    query = cb.select(AssetGroup).where('name:"HQ Devices"')
    group = query.first()
