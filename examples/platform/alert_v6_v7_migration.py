This example shows changes required in Alerts code to move from Carbon Black Cloud Python SDK v1.4.3 to 1.5.0

SDK v1.4.3 and earlier used the Alerts v6 API.  SDK 1.5.0 uses Alerts v7 API which has significantly more metadata
on the Alert record, but also some breaking changes.

It complements the Alert Migration guide available in Read The Docs
https://carbon-black-cloud-python-sdk.readthedocs.io
-->  Guides --> Migration Guides --> Alert Migration

Significant effort was put towards backwards compatibility to minimise the breaking changes in SDK 1.5.0.
