This example shows how to use the Alerts API and relate Alerts to other objects such as Processes and Observations.

The SDK documentation is published on Read The Docs.  An Alerts Guide is available there.
https://carbon-black-cloud-python-sdk.readthedocs.io

If you are using SDK version 1.4.3 or earlier, see the related example script, alert_v6_v7_migration.py,
also in examples/platform and the Alert Migration Guide on Read the Docs on the changes that are needed.
SDK v1.5.0 does have breaking changes.

    1. Use an Alert Search to specify the alerts that will have their status updated

    * The request body is a search request and all alerts matching the request will be updated.
    * Two common uses are to update one alert, or to update all alerts with a specific threat id.
    * Any search request can be used as the criteria to select alerts to update the alert status.

    2. Submit a job to update the status of Alerts.

    * The status can be ``OPEN``, ``IN PROGRESS`` or ``CLOSED`` (previously ``DISMISSED``).
    * A Closure Reason may be included.

    3. The immediate response confirms the job was successfully submitted.

    4. Use the :py:mod:`Job() cbc_sdk.platform.jobs.Job` class to determine when the update is complete.

    * Use job.await_completion().result()

    5. Refresh the Alert Search to get the updated alert data into the SDK.

    6. The future Alerts with the same threat id can be set to automatically close.
