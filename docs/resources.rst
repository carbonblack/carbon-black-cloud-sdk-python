Resources
====================

Here you can find examples, recorded demonstrations, and other resources we think will be useful
to get the most out of the Carbon Black Cloud Python SDK.

Audience for These Resources
-------------------------

In general, and unless otherwise indicated, these guides are directed at those that:

- Have a working knowledge of Python.
- Have a basic understanding of what the Carbon Black Cloud does, and its basic terminology such as events, alerts,
  and watchlists.

Certain guides may be more geared towards audiences with more experience with the Carbon Black Cloud, such as
administrators.

Examples
--------

The `GitHub repository <https://github.com/carbonblack/carbon-black-cloud-sdk-python/tree/develop/examples>`_ also has
some example scripts which will help you get started using the SDK.

Recordings
----------

Demonstrations are found on our `YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz0s1WuJAe7rt_dA1v-dN9g/featured>`_.
