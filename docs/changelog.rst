Changelog
================================
CBC SDK 1.4.3 - Released June 26, 2023
--------------------------------------

New Features:

* Policy Rule Configurations - support for additional rule configuration types:

    disable auth events collection.

  exception to be raised.

Bug Fixes:

* Fixed link validation for reports and IOCs to accept IPv4 addresses, domain names, or URIs.

Documentation:

* Documentation has been reorganized for ease of reference; guides have been added to the main menu, the menu has been
  reordered, and various modules have been renamed.

CBC SDK 1.4.0 - Released July 26,2022
-------------------------------------

**Breaking Changes:**

* ``Policy`` object has been moved from ``cbc_sdk.endpoint_standard`` to ``cbc_sdk.platform``, as it now uses the new
  Policy Services API rather than the old APIs through Integration Services.

  - **N.B.:** This change means that you *must* use a custom API key with permissions under ``org.policies`` to manage
    policies, rather than an older "API key."
  - To enable time to update integration logic, the ``cbc_sdk.endpoint_standard Policy`` object may still be imported
    from the old package, and supports operations that are backwards-compatible with the old one.
  - When developing a new integration, or updating an existing one cbc_sdk.platform should be used. There is a utility
    class ``PolicyBuilder``, and as features are added to the Carbon Black Cloud, they will be added to this module.

* Official support for Python 3.6 has been dropped, since that version is now end-of-life.  Added explicit testing
  support for Python versions 3.9 and 3.10.  **N.B.:** End users should update their Python version to 3.7.x or
  greater.

New Features:

* Credentials handler now supports OAuth tokens.
* Added support for querying a single ``Report`` from a ``Feed``.
* Added support for alert notes (create, delete, get, refresh).

Updates:

* Removed the (unused) ``revoked`` property from ``Grant`` objects.
* Increased the asynchronous query thread pool to 3 threads by default.
* Required version of ``lxml`` is now 4.9.1.
* Added a user acceptance test script for Alerts.

Bug Fixes:

* Added ``max_rows`` to USB device query, fixing pagination.
* Fixed an off-by-one error in Alerts Search resulting un duplicate alerts showing up in results.
* Fixed an error in alert faceting operations due to sending excess input to the server.

Documentation:

* Watchlists, Feeds, and Reports guide has been updated with additional clarification and examples.
* Updated description for some ``Device`` fields that are never populated.
* Additional sensor states added to ``Device`` documentation.
* Fixed the description of ``BaseAlertSearchQuery.set_types`` so that it mentions all valid alert types.
* Threat intelligence example has been deprecated.

* Added a ``CredentialProvider`` that uses AWS Secrets Manager to store credential information.

Updates:

* Updated pretty-printing of objects containing ``dict`` members.
* ``lxml`` dependency updated to version 4.6.5.
