Getting Started with the Carbon Black Cloud Python SDK - "Hello CBC"
====================================================================
This document will help you get started with the Carbon Black Cloud Python SDK by installing it, configuring
authentication for it, and executing a simple example program that makes one API call.

Installation
------------
Make sure you are using Python 3.  Use the command ``pip install carbon-black-cloud-sdk`` to install the SDK and all its dependencies.
(In some environments, the correct command will be ``pip3 install carbon-black-cloud-sdk`` to use Python 3.)

You can also access the SDK in development mode by cloning the GitHub repository, and then executing
``python setup.py develop`` (in some environments, ``python3 setup.py develop``) from the top-level directory.
Setting your ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable to the directory ``[sdk]/src``, where ``[sdk]`` is the top-level
directory of the SDK, will also work for these purposes.  (On Windows, use ``[sdk]\src``.)

See also the :doc:`installation` section of this documentation for more information.

Authentication
--------------
To make use of APIs, you will need an *API token,* in case you are using Carbon Black Cloud to manage your
identity and authentication, or if you are using VMware Cloud Services Platform, an *OAuth App with Bearer* or a *Personal API Token*.
For our example, we will use a custom CBC-managed key with the ability to list devices.
To learn more about the different authentication methods, click `here <https://developer.carbonblack.com/reference/carbon-black-cloud/authentication/>`_.

Log into the Carbon Black Cloud UI and go to ``Settings > API Access``.  Start by selecting ``Access Levels`` at the
top of the screen and press ``Add Access Level``.  Fill in a name and description for your sample access level, keep
``Copy permissions from`` set to ``None``, and, under the permission category ``Device`` and permission name
``General information``, check the ``Read`` check box.  Press ``Save`` to save and create the new access level.

Now select ``API Keys`` at the top of the screen and press ``Add API Key``.  Enter a name for the key, and, optionally,
a description.  For ``Access Level type``, select ``Custom``, and for ``Custom Access Level``, select the access level
you created above.  Press ``Save`` to save and create the new API key.  An ``API Credentials`` dialog will be displayed
with the new API ID and secret key; this dialog may also be re-displayed at any time by finding the API key in the list,
clicking the drop-down arrow under the ``Actions`` column, and selecting ``API Credentials``.

We will use a credentials file to store the credential information by default.  Create a directory named
``.carbonblack`` under your user home directory. (On Windows, this directory is generally ``C:\Users\[username]``,
where ``[username]`` is your user name.)  Within this directory create a file ``credentials.cbc`` to store your
credentials.  Copy the following template to this new file::

    [default]
    url=
    token=
    org_key=
    ssl_verify=True

Following the ``url=`` keyword, add the top-level URL you use to access the Carbon Black Cloud, including the
``https://`` prefix and the domain name, but without any of the path information following it.

Following the ``token=`` keyword, add the ``API Secret Key`` from the ``API Credentials`` dialog, followed by a forward
slash (/) character, followed by the ``API ID`` from the ``API Credentials`` dialog.  (The secret key is always 24
characters in length, and the API ID is always 10 characters in length.)

Following the ``org_key=`` keyword, add the organization key from your organization, which may be seen under the
``Org Key:`` heading at the top of the ``API Keys`` display under ``Settings > API Access``.  It is always 8 characters
in length.

Save the completed ``credentials.cbc`` file, which should look like this *(example text only)*::

    [default]
    url=https://example.net
    token=ABCDEFGHGIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX/ABCDEFGHIJ
    org_key=A1B2C3D4
    ssl_verify=True

On UNIX systems, you must make sure that the ``credentials.cbc`` file is properly secured.  The simplest commands for
doing so are::

    $ chmod 600 ~/.carbonblack/credentials.cbc
    $ chmod 700 ~/.carbonblack

For further information, please see the :doc:`authentication` section of the documentation, as well as the
`Authentication Guide <https://developer.carbonblack.com/reference/carbon-black-cloud/authentication/>`_ on the
Carbon Black Cloud Developer Network.

Running the Example
-------------------
The example we will be running is ``list_devices.py``, located in the ``examples/platform`` subdirectory of the GitHub
repository.  If you cloned the repository, change directory to ``[sdk]/examples/platform``, where ``[sdk]`` is the
top-level directory of the SDK.  (On Windows, use ``[sdk]\examples\platform``.)  Alternately, you may view the current
version of that script in "raw" mode in GitHub, and use your browser's ``Save As`` function to save the script locally.
In that case, change directory to whichever directory you saved the script to.

Execute the script by using the command ``python list_devices.py -q '1'`` (in some environments,
``python3 list_devices.py -q '1'``).  If all is well, you will see a list of devices (endpoints) registered in your
organization, showing their numeric ID, host name, IP address, and last checkin time.

You can change what devices are shown by modifying the query value supplied to the ``-q`` parameter, and also by using
additional parameters to modify the search criteria.  Execute the command ``python list_devices.py --help`` (in some
environments, ``python3 list_devices.py --help``) for a list of all possible command line parameters.

Inside the Example Script
-------------------------
Once the command-line arguments are parsed, we create a Carbon Black Cloud API object with a call to the helper
function ``get_cb_cloud_object()``.  The standard ``select()`` method is used to create a query object that queries for
devices; the query string is passed to that object via the ``where()`` method, and other criteria are added using
specific setters.

The query is an iterable object, and calling upon its iterator methods invokes the query, which, in this case, is the
`Search Devices <https://developer.carbonblack.com/reference/carbon-black-cloud/platform/latest/devices-api/#search-devices>`_
API.  The example script turns those results into an in-memory list, then iterates on that list, printing only certain
properties of each retrieved Device object.

Calling the SDK Directly
------------------------
Now we'll repeat this example, but using the Python command line directly without a script.

Access your Python interpreter with the ``python`` command (or ``python3`` if required) and type:

>>> from cbc_sdk.rest_api import CBCloudAPI
>>> from cbc_sdk.platform import Device
>>> cb = CBCloudAPI(profile='default')

This imports the necessary classes and creates an instance of the base ``CBCloudAPI`` object.  By default, the file
credentials provider is used. We set it to use the ``default`` profile in your ``credentials.cbc`` file, which you
set up earlier.

**N.B.:** On Windows, a security warning message will be generated about file access to CBC SDK credentials being
inherently insecure.

>>> query = cb.select(Device).where('1')

This creates a query object that searches for all devices (the '1' causes all devices to be matched, as in SQL).

>>> devices = list(query)

For convenience, we load the entirety of the query results into an in-memory list.

>>> for device in devices:
...     print(device.id, device.name, device.last_internal_ip_address, device.last_contact_time)
...

Using a simple ``for`` loop, we print out the ID, host name, internal IP address, and last contact time from each
returned device.  Note that the contents of the list are ``Device`` objects, not dictionaries, so we access individual
properties with the ``object.property_name`` syntax, rather than ``object['property_name']``.

Setting the User-Agent
----------------------

The SDK supports custom User-Agent's, which allow you to identify yourself when using the SDK to make API calls.
The credential parameter ``integration_name`` is used for this. If you use a file to authenticate the SDK, this is
how you could identify yourself:

::

  [default]
  url=http://example.com
  token=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX/12345678
  org_key=A1B2C3D4
  integration_name=MyScript/0.9.0

See the :doc:`authentication` documentation for more information about credentials.
