## Documentation

Visit [ReadTheDocs](https://carbon-black-cloud-python-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for this project's documentation.

## Requirements

The Carbon Black Cloud Python SDK is design to work on Python 3.8 and above.

All requirements are installed as part of `pip install carbon-black-cloud-sdk`. If you're planning on pushing changes to the Carbon Black Cloud Python SDK, the following can be used after cloning the repo `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Carbon Black Cloud

At least one Carbon Black Cloud product is required to use this SDK:

* [Platform](https://developer.carbonblack.com/reference/carbon-black-cloud/platform-apis/)
* [Endpoint Standard](https://developer.carbonblack.com/reference/carbon-black-cloud/cb-defense/)
* [Audit and Remediation](https://developer.carbonblack.com/reference/carbon-black-cloud/cb-liveops/)
* [Enterprise EDR](https://developer.carbonblack.com/reference/carbon-black-cloud/cb-threathunter/)
* [Workload](https://developer.carbonblack.com/reference/carbon-black-cloud/workload-protection/)

### Python Packages

- requests
- pyyaml
- python-dateutil
- schema
- solrq
- jsonschema
- validators
- keyring (for MacOS)

If developing the SDK, you also need:

- pytest==5.4.2
- pymox==1.0.0
- coverage==5.1
- coveralls==2.0.0
- flake8==3.8.1
- flake8-colors==0.1.6
- flake8-docstrings==1.5.0
- pre-commit>=2.15.0


## Getting Started

Visit the [Getting Started Guide](https://carbon-black-cloud-python-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started) for an example of authenticating and making an API call using the SDK.

### Setting the User-Agent

The SDK supports custom User-Agent's when making API calls. This allows you to identify yourself when using the SDK. See [Setting the User-Agent](https://carbon-black-cloud-python-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started#setting-the-user-agent) section of the documentation for more information.

## Developing Improvements for the Carbon Black Cloud Python SDK

Use the following steps if you want to provide additional examples, fix a bug, or add a feature to the SDK.

### Installing for SDK development

You will need to fork the repo in order to create pull requests when submitting code for review. For details on forking a repo, see [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

```
git clone https://github.com/{fork-name}/carbon-black-cloud-sdk-python
cd carbon-black-cloud-sdk-python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note: Before contributing any code please make sure to read the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) page.**

If you want to test/execute the example scripts from the repo then install the SDK with the following command. This will install the SDK in editable mode so changes to the repo modify the installed package.

```
pip install -e .
```

**Note: The above command needs to be run from the base folder of the repo**


### Running the SDK tests

From the parent directory `carbon-black-cloud-sdk-python`, run the command `pytest`.

### Building the documentation

#### Locally
ReadTheDocs hosts [the documentation for the SDK](https://carbon-black-cloud-python-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). If you make changes to the SDK that require an update to the documentation, first install the documentation packages from pip:

```
pip install sphinxcontrib-apidoc sphinx_rtd_theme sphinx-copybutton
```

Then, build the docs locally with the following commands:

```
cd docs
make html
```

Note that the module rst files such as ```docs/cbc_sdk.platform.rst ``` are handcrafted to control layout.
* This command will generate new version, but it is not necessary and changes should not be added to the repository.
* All pull requests will trigger a build of the documentation which can be viewed from Read The Docs --> Builds.
```
sphinx-apidoc -f -o docs src/cbc_sdk
```

The documentation is built in `docs/_build/html`.

**N.B.:** If your documentation pages appear to generate incorrectly, check to see if you received the warning message
`No module named 'cbc_sdk'`.  If so, set your `PYTHONPATH` to include the `src/` subdirectory of the SDK project
directory before running `make html`, or the equivalent command `sphinx-build -M html . _build`.

#### Pull-Requests

The webhook with readthedocs will create a build of the branch and report on the status of the build to the GitHub pull request

#### Using Docker

Build the documentation by running:
```shell
$ docker run -p 7000:7000 -it $(docker build -f ./docker/docs/Dockerfile . -q) make livehtml
```

### Development Flow

To begin a code change, start by creating a branch off of the develop branch.
```
git checkout develop
git checkout -b {branch-name}
```

When the feature or bug fix is finished you will need to create a pull request to the CarbonBlack repo, the following will push your changes to Github.
```
git push {remote} {branch-name}
```

If your branch is behind the develop branch, you will need to rebase.
```
git checkout {branch-name}
git rebase develop
```

**Note:** if your develop branch is out of sync with the Carbon Black repo then you will need to sync your fork. For information on syncing your fork, see [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork).
