    python3 -m virtualenv ./venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    python3 setup.py develop

Make sure the tests pass:

    pytest

## Developing

Install the dev dependencies and after that it is highly recommended installing `pre-commit`. 

    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    pre-commit install
    ...

The `pre-commit` will make sure that you have the right code quality before committing your changes. 

Make sure to:
* Write documentation and tests. 
* Perform all the other tests. 
* Push to your fork and 
[submit a pull request](https://github.com/carbonblack/carbon-black-cloud-sdk-python/compare/).

We try to respond to pull requests as quickly as possible. We may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Follow [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/), and clean code principles.
* Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
* Usage of [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
